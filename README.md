My Sinatra Vegan app is created so a user can sign up and/or log in and post their own vegan recipes!

If you want to use this app, click the link https://github.com/cantstopcoding/vegan_recipes_sinatra_app and clone the repository. To install the gems and their dependencies run bundle install in the terminal. To start up the app, type shotgun in the terminal and go http://localhost:9393/ in your terminal.

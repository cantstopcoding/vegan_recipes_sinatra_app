**BEFORE YOU CODE**

- [x] 1. Check project requirements in 'spec.md'
- [x] 2. Ideate! What do you want to build?
      - choose a domain you're familiar with!
      - choose a domain you care about
- [ ] 3. Wireframing & User Stories
      - Write down your models, their attributes, and their associations
      - "As a user, I can ......"
      - What does your app do?
- [ ] 4. Design your MVP = 'Minimum Viable Product' vs. what are my 'streatch goals'
      - Streatch goals - bonus feature you want but don't need 

**NOW WE CODE (BUT JUST OUR MODELS - NO CONTROLLERS OR VIEWS)**

- [x] 5. generate new project using corneal gem
- [x] 6. Create github repo
- [x] 7. Build your models
      - Migrations
      - Model classes
      - Associations 
- [x] 8. Test your models and associations in the console
      - Create some seed data
      - Tested our associations in tux
      - Adjust migrations as needed

### PART 2 â€” User Authentication

**NOW, CONSIDER USER CONTROLLER, APPLICATION CONTROLLER, AND VIEWS**

*IMPORTANT:* Build views and controller actions based on the flow of your app, one step at a time, testing as you go!

Use shotgun and pry (or raise/inspect) all the time!

 9. Start with your UsersController

Add your get login/signup/logout routes
Add your post login/sign up routes
 10. Enable sessions in ApplicationController

Enable sessions
Create session secret
 
 11. Create your views

display login form
display signup form
user show page
 
 12. Create your ApplicationController helper methods

#logged_in?
#current_user
 13. Build out controller routes for other models (add a controller for each model)
